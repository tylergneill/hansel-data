            <note>This famous literary work was begun by Bāṇa Bhaṭṭa (so-called Pūrvabhāga, pp. 1–237) and finished by his son Bhūṣaṇa Bhaṭṭa (Uttarabhāga, pp. 239–369). It is fully extant. Peterson's edition, on which this e-text is based, added paragraph breaks as further structure. (Later editions also added headers to indicate beginnings of significant portions of the story, but those are not used here.) The overall story is that of a romance between the two characters Candrāpīḍa and Kādambarī, but the book also contains innumerable side stories.</note>

            <p>The published edition from which this e-text was transcribed is printed in the
                Devanāgarī script. The electronic text below is in a lossless transliteration
                using the Latin alphabet. The transliteration scheme used is the IAST (<ref
                    target="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration"
                    >The International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration</ref>). IAST differs
                in small ways from ISO 15919, but is preferred by most working Sanskrit
                scholars. Conversion of this file to ISO 15919 can be achieved by performing the
                following replacements throughout the file:
                <ul>
                    <li><code>ṛ -> r̥</code></li>
                    <li><code>ḷ -> l̥</code></li>
                    <li><code>ṃ -> ṁ </code></li>
                    <li><code>e -> ē</code></li>
                    <li><code>o -> ō</code></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Text division is as Devanāgarī ("ityevam" not "ity evam".) </p>
            <normalization>
                <p>Initial vowel elision for avagraha is reversed and marked with a + sign:
                    e.g., "prathamo+adhyāyaḥ"</p>
            </normalization>
            <p>Similarly, external sandhis are undone and marked: "yathā+amarā"</p>
            <p>The ampersand (&amp;) was used by the inputters as an anchor to mark places in
                the e-text where the printed edition has a footnote, and again with the text of
                the related footnote being placed nearby in the e-text. I have regularized these
                footnotes in many, but not all, cases, changing them to <tag>note</tag>s. The
                use of the ampersand may still be irregular in places, and needs to be checked
                against the edition, and some notes have been omitted and need to be added from
                the edition.</p>
            <p>The notes by Trivikramātmaja Ācārya are included in the e-text . using the
                    <tag>note</tag> element. </p>
            <segmentation>
                <p>A first cut has been made at distinguishing verse and prose. Prose passages
                    are enclosed in the normal <tag>p</tag> tags. Verse passages are grouped
                    within the line-group tag, <tag>lg</tag>, and individually tagged as verse
                    lines, <tag>l</tag>.</p>
                <p>Inserted comments <tag>!-- subdivision --</tag> and <tag>!-- /subdivision
                        --</tag> around passages where the text section is subdivided into a
                    level below that of the surrounding text. These comment tags need to be
                    replaced with something better, but we can't use <tag>div3</tag>, for
                    example, because of the problem of TEI's policy on tessellation. See TEI
                    Guidelines P5, section 4.3.2, et passim. Nor are these subdivisions floating
                    text, or groups, or other obvious units. They could be marked with
                        <tag>span</tag>s (<tag>span type="interesting" spanTo="#xy"</tag>
                        ...<tag>anchor xml:id="xy"</tag>) or <tag>milestone</tag>s, but these
                    mechanisms seem clumsy. The question stands for now. </p>
