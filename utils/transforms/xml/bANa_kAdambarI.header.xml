            <note>This famous literary work was begun by Bāṇa Bhaṭṭa (so-called Pūrvabhāga, Peterson ed. pp. 1–237) and finished by his son Bhūṣaṇa Bhaṭṭa (Uttarabhāga, pp. 239–369). It is fully extant. Peterson's edition, on which this e-text is based, added paragraph breaks as further structure. Later editions also added headers to indicate beginnings of significant portions of the story, but those are not used here. The overall story is that of a romance between the two characters Candrāpīḍa and Kādambarī, but the book also contains innumerable side stories.</note>

              I (Tyler Neill) produced this HANSEL edition
              by first running a PDF of the 1885 edition through
              both Google Cloud Vision OCR
              and Gemini 2.5 Flash via Dharmamitra.
              These two OCR outputs were then automatically harmonized
              using Gemini 2.5 Pro and a custom prompt.
              Finally, the harmonized OCR output was contrasted against the previous version by Andrew Ollett
              (which was in fact based on 1885/1889 as well)
              using Meld,
              and differences were reconciled individually with reference to the PDF.

              The published edition from which this e-text was transcribed is printed in the Devanāgarī script. The electronic text below is in a lossless transliteration using the Latin alphabet. The transliteration scheme used is the IAST (<ref target="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration">The International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration</ref>). IAST differs in small ways from ISO 15919, but is preferred by most working Sanskrit scholars. Conversion of this file to ISO 15919 can be achieved by performing the following replacements throughout the file:
               <ul>
                   <li><code>ṛ -> r̥</code></li>
                   <li><code>ḷ -> l̥</code></li>
                   <li><code>ṃ -> ṁ </code></li>
                   <li><code>e -> ē</code></li>
                   <li><code>o -> ō</code></li>
               </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
              Text division is as Devanāgarī ("ityevam" not "ity evam".)

              Errors discovered in the source edition and fixed in this electronic version are marked with the following:
