# Utils and Static Data Bundle

This folder contains code that transforms HANSEL's core files
— master texts (.txt, .xml) and metadata (.md) —
into other formats (.html, .json, .zip).

## Versioning

While the core data is versioned with datestamps,
this utility code and the data it generates are versioned separately using Semantic Versioning.
Both versions are recorded in the repository's `VERSION` file.
