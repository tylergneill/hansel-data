# Utils and Static Data Bundle

This folder contains code that generates additional data types 
from HANSEL's core files (originals, processed plain text, and Markdown metadata).

## Versioning

While the core data is versioned with a simple datestamp,
this utility code and the data it generates are versioned separately using Semantic Versioning.
Both versions are recorded in the project's `VERSION` file.
