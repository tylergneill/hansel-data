    "Work Description": "Ślokavārttika is one of the foundational texts of classical Indian philosophy, especially for understanding how Sanskrit intellectuals argued about knowledge, language, and authority. In it, Kumārila argues that Vedic language is a reliable means for knowing what human beings ought to do, not because of the intention of any human or divine author, but because of stable, conventional relations inherent in language itself. Though formally a commentary on parts of Jaimini’s Mīmāṃsāsūtra, the work functions less as explanation than as intertextual polemic, sharpening debates with Buddhists, Naiyāyikas, and rival Mīmāṃsakas in tightly compressed verse. For getting started with this notoriously difficult text, the most reliable English-language resources are the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy articles on Mīmāṃsā and Testimony (śabda), together with John Taber’s essays on Kumārila and svataḥ prāmāṇya.",

    "Work Description": "This famous literary work — a romance between two main characters Candrāpīḍa and Kādambarī, plus innumerable side stories — was begun by Bāṇa Bhaṭṭa (570–650 CE) and finished posthumously by his son Bhūṣaṇa Bhaṭṭa (600–660 CE). These two contributions are the so-called Pūrvabhāga (Peterson ed. pp. 1–237) and Uttarabhāga (pp. 239–369), respectively. Peterson's edition, on which this e-text is based, added paragraph breaks as further structure. Later editions and translations also add headers to indicate beginnings of significant portions of the story, but no such headers are used here.",

    "Digitization Notes": [
      "(2022-02-01) Andrew Ollett: Initial OCR (using Google Cloud Vision, on 1885/9 edition — not 1883 as noted), some proofreading, XML markup for SARIT, uploaded to GitHub.",
      "(2024–2025) Tyler Neill: Second OCR (using two models, on 1885 edition, merged with AI), manual reconciliation of differences relative to previous version, some more proofreading, markup for HANSEL."
    ],
    "File Creation Method": "I (Tyler Neill) produced this HANSEL edition by first running a PDF of the 1885 edition through both Google Cloud Vision OCR (via Skrutable) and Gemini 2.0 Flash (via Dharmamitra). These two OCR outputs were then automatically harmonized using Gemini 2.5 Pro (via direct API and using a custom prompt). Finally, the harmonized OCR output was contrasted against the previous version by Andrew Ollett (which was in fact based on 1885/1889 as well) using Meld, and differences were reconciled individually with reference to the PDF. The text still needs a final proofread.",
