In the frame, a pet parrot belongs to a young, lonely woman named Prabhāvatī, and he seeks to keep her faithful while her merchant husband, Madanavinoda, is away on business. Each night, when Prabhāvatī is tempted to meet a lover, the clever bird tells her a story meant to dissuade her. After seventy nights of such tales, her husband returns, and she has remained true, bringing the drama to a close. The stories feature clever protagonists who extricate themselves from difficult situations, especially women who outsmart men in episodes involving adultery.",
