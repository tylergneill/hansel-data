# Digitization Notes

- (2022) Andrew Ollett: Initial OCR (1885/9 edition used, not 1883 as noted), some proofreading, XML markup for SARIT, uploaded to GitHub.
- (2024–2025) Tyler Neill: Second OCR (1885 edition, 2 models, merged with AI), manual reconciliation of differences relative to previous version, some more proofreading, markup for HANSEL.

# File Creation Method

I (Tyler Neill) produced this HANSEL edition by first running a PDF of the 1885 edition through both Google Cloud Vision OCR (via Skrutable) and Gemini 2.5 Flash (via Dharmamitra). These two OCR outputs were then automatically harmonized using Gemini 2.5 Pro (via direct API) and a custom prompt. Finally, the harmonized OCR output was contrasted against the previous version by Andrew Ollett (which was in fact based on 1885/1889 as well) using Meld, and differences were reconciled individually with reference to the PDF. The text still needs a final proofread.

# Work Description

This famous literary work was begun by Bāṇa Bhaṭṭa (so-called Pūrvabhāga, Peterson ed. pp. 1–237) and finished posthumously by his son Bhūṣaṇa Bhaṭṭa (Uttarabhāga, pp. 239–369). The complete work is extant. Peterson's edition, on which this e-text is based, added paragraph breaks as further structure. Later editions also added headers to indicate beginnings of significant portions of the story, but these are not used here. The overall story is that of a romance between the two characters Candrāpīḍa and Kādambarī, but the book also contains innumerable side stories.
