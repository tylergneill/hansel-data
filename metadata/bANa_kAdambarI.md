# Structural Notes

The text has no inherent structure other than the widely recognized distinction of Pūrvabhāga (attributed to Bāṇa himself) and Uttarabhāga (completed by Bāṇa's son, Bhūṣaṇabhaṭṭa, after Bāṇa's death).

Paragraphs as created by Peterson are marked by starting page and line number.
