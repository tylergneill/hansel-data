# Additional Notes

- The Simplicior is believed to be older than the Ornatior.
- Indian editions (e.g. Ramakant Tripathi, Vārāṇasī, 1966, basis of the GRETIL text) are based on this Simplicior text by Schmidt.
- V. Gostishchev's original (= Tier I) version of the file contains added chāyās from the Indian editions and other useful notes.
