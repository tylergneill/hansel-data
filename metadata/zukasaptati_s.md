# Additional Notes

- Indian editions (e.g. Ramakant Tripathi, Vārāṇasī, 1966, basis of the GRETIL text) are based on this _Simplicior_ text by Schmidt.
- V. Gostishchev's original version of the file contains added _chāyās_ from the Indian editions and other useful notes.
- On construction of the text, see the editor's 1890 PhD dissertation “Vier Erzählungen aus der Çukasaptati”, [on Google Books](https://books.google.fr/books?id=iq5LAQAAMAAJ)
