# Digitization

Initial digitization steps on Ambuda platform:
- `2022-08-13`: item created (and Google Cloud Vision OCR likely performed) by user `suhasm`
- `2023-03-06`–`2023-05-08`: proofread once by user `shivjun1685`
- `2025-05-24`–`2025-07-21`: proofread second time by Tyler Neill

In fact, the second “proofreading” was done offline, 
with use of fresh OCR and generative AI to guarantee quality throughout,
plus structural transformation for HANSEL,
and the Ambuda website was updated with a form of this result with reduced structural markup.
