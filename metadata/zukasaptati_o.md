# Digitization Notes

- (Aug 2022) Suhas Mahesh (Ambuda user `suhasm`): Item created, Google Cloud Vision OCR performed.

# File Creation Method

I (Tyler Neill) produced this HANSEL edition by first extracting the text page-by-page from the Ambuda website “Proofing” section. I then ran a PDF of the edition through both Google Cloud Vision OCR (via Skrutable) and Gemini 2.0 Flash (via Dharmamitra). These two OCR outputs were then automatically harmonized using Gemini 2.5 Pro (via direct API and using a custom prompt). This harmonized OCR output was then contrasted against the Ambuda-derived version using Meld and differences were reconciled individually with reference to the PDF. I then fully proofread the text, word by word. Finally, I contributed content improvements back to Ambuda using its page-by-page Proofing interface.
